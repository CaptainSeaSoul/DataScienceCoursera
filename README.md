# IBM Data Science Coursera
The final course of the 10 course series "Applied Data Science Capstone" challenges the students to show what they have learned. It consists of 5 modules where each builds one upon another to complete a realistic task. <br>
Our goal is to predict if the Falcon 9 (by SpaceX) first stage will land successfully. We follow these steps:<br>
<ul>
    <li>Exploratory Data Analysis </li>
    <li>Interactive Visual Analytics and Dashboard</li>
    <li>Predictive Analysis (Classification)</li>
    <li>Present Data-Driven Insights</li>
</ul>
